# LMS
# Project Proposal: Library Management System Using UML Design 
# Members: Priyanka Saha, Sifat Sabrina Rahman 
### 1. Introduction 
Modern libraries require robust software to track books, patrons, loans, and fines. A well
designed Library Management System (LMS) improves efficiency, reduces errors, and 
provides better user services. This project will demonstrate how UML modeling can drive 
both design clarity mostly and code generation. 
### 2. Objectives 
1. Capture requirements using UML Use Case and Activity diagrams. 
2. Design system structure via UML Class and Component diagrams. 
3. Model dynamic behavior with Sequence and State Machine diagrams. 
4. Generate skeleton code from Class diagrams using a UML tool. 
5. Deliver a small prototype supporting book catalog, member management, and 
loan processing. 
### 3. Scope – In scope: 
• Book catalog management (add/update/remove/search) 
• Member registration and profile management 
• Loan and return workflows, including due date and fine calculation 
• Reporting: overdue items list, inventory summary – Out of scope: 
• Online reservation/payment gateways 
• Deep analytics (recommendation engine) 
### 4. Process: 
1. Draft high-level Use Case and Activity diagrams. 
2. Refine domain model in Class diagrams, assign attributes & operations. 
3. Model key scenarios (e.g., loan processing) with Sequence diagrams. 
4. Validate behavior with State Machine diagrams for Loan objects. 
5. Generate Java/Python code skeletons from Class diagrams. 
6. Implement core CRUD operations and simple console/UI views. 

### 5. Development Preference:
1. Backend (Express.js + MongoDB)
2. Frontend React
3. RESTful API
4. JWT Authentication

### 6. System Testing:
